## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

Needed input fields to pass in values for employee salary information, resulted in making a form element in HTML doc.

After having a form to place input fields, added a submit button.

Used a preventDefault operation to avoid the page refreshing but tagged a function to the button that creates a 'list' of the added employees along with inputs.

Project requried us to calculate employee Total Annual Salary, therefore reviewed functions that would sum up the total annual salaries together.

The same is true with some minor adjustments to calculate the 'Monthly Salary Breakdown" and adjusting a function for that.

Used an 'if' statement based on the function parameters to add a Red background style property for monthly salaries above the threshold in assignment.

A delete button was required in order to remove an employee and all input data associated that element, added button element within the 'Form' body of HTML.

Alongside the delete button, a separate function to delete any employee from the salary generator was added, adding utility to the page.

Stretch goals asked to attempt using appropriate CSS properities, I tried to mimic the example by adding 'Table" elements in the HTML doc.

By adding a table, I needed to declare and set the employee inputs into table rows, therefore adjusting the JS file and declaring several variables while simultaneously creating cells and rows to be added with each new block.

I am happy that I made it this far, despite having to research many different things to see how it would work and experimenting with it. I am still frustrated that my red background does not go away depsite my attempts at coding it and ensuring the placement of that 'if' statement flows properly with the logic of the functions.
